# Cornerstone + TailWindCSS + Prettier BigCommerce Starter Theme

BigCommerce Cornerstone theme with TailWindCSS &amp; Prettier integrations

The starter theme includes an integration of:

## [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

- [Configured](https://markustripp.medium.com/extend-shopify-dawn-theme-with-a-custom-tailwind-css-carousel-section-e3efe3ecf18e) to use `prefix: tw-` in order to not clash with Cornerstone's existing styles

## [Trellis' Prettier config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trelliscommerce/prettier-config) with Husky pre-commit hooks

- Formats JS, SCSS, & CSS whenever a git commit is made
- Setup your own VSCode to apply Prettier formatting when a file is saved (optional)

## Steps to Start Using this Starter Theme

1. Fork this repository, navigate to the directory, run `npm install`

2. After `npm install` has completed, run `npm run tailwind` to start the Tailwind `--watch` [command](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

## Stencil Push Your Theme

1. Create an [API token](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/ZG9jOjIyMDcwMQ-live-previewing-a-theme) with theme publishing permissions

2. To connect to your store, run `stencil init --url https://XXX.mybigcommerce.com --token XXX`

3. To pull down the configuration from the active theme on your live store and updates your local configuration, run `stencil pull`

4. To bundle your theme into a zip file and then push the theme to your BigCommerce store, run `stencil push`

## Common local development commands

1. Before beginning any work, it is good practice to pull down the latest changes from the BigCommerce Cornerstone theme:

```
git fetch upstream
git pull upstream main
```

2. Add upstream link if you get the error `fatal: 'upstream' does not appear to be a git repository` run: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone.git` or `git remote add upstream https://github.com/TrellisCommerce/bigcommerce-tailwind-starter-base.git` depending on which repository you want to pull updates from

3. Anytime you add a TailwindCSS class (remember to prefix it with tw-), run the CLI tool to scan your template files for classes and build your CSS to assets/app.css:
   `npx tailwindcss -i ./assets/scss/tailwind-src.css -o ./assets/scss/tailwind.scss --watch`

- Run this command in a separate terminal so it will continue to run while you are developing.

## Static assets

Some static assets in the Stencil theme are handled with Grunt if required. This
means you have some dependencies on grunt and npm. To get started:

First make sure you have Grunt installed globally on your machine:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

and run:

```
npm install
```

Note: package-lock.json file was generated by Node version 10 and npm version 6.11.3. The app supports Node 10 as well as multiple versions of npm, but we should always use those versions when updating package-lock.json, unless it is decided to upgrade those, and in this case the readme should be updated as well. If using a different version for node OR npm, please delete the package-lock.json file prior to installing node packages and also prior to pushing to github.

If updating or adding a dependency, please double check that you are working on Node version 10 and npm version 6.11.3 and run `npm update <package_name>` or `npm install <package_name>` (avoid running npm install for updating a package). After updating the package, please make sure that the changes in the package-lock.json reflect only the updated/new package prior to pushing the changes to github.

### Icons

Icons are delivered via a single SVG sprite, which is embedded on the page in
`templates/layout/base.html`. It is generated via a grunt task `grunt svgstore`.

The task takes individual SVG files for each icon in `assets/icons` and bundles
them together, to be inlined on the top of the theme, via an ajax call managed
by svg-injector. Each icon can then be called in a similar way to an inline image via:

```
<svg><use xlink:href="#icon-svgFileName" /></svg>
```

The ID of the SVG icon you are calling is based on the filename of the icon you want,
with `icon-` prepended. e.g. `xlink:href="#icon-facebook"`.

Simply add your new icon SVG file to the icons folder, and run `grunt svgstore`,
or just `grunt`.
